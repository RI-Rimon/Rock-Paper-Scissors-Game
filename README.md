## Rock Paper Scissors Game (C)

This is a simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game implemented in the **C programming language**.  
The project was created during my learning phase to practice core C concepts such as conditional statements, random number generation, and basic input/output handling.

## 📌 About the Project
- The user selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- The computer generates a random choice.
- The program compares both choices and determines the winner.

This project focuses on **logic building and fundamentals**, rather than advanced features or optimization.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- C Programming Language
- Standard C Libraries (`stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `time.h`)

## ▶ How to Run
1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g. GCC):
   ```bash
   gcc main.c -o rps
   
Run the executable:

bash
Copy code
./rps


🎯 Purpose
This project is part of my continuous learning journey in programming.
It reflects my understanding of basic C programming concepts and problem-solving logic.

📚 Learning Status
Beginner-level project

Created for practice and concept reinforcement

More advanced improvements may be added in the future as my skills grow
